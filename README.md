PLA Calculator
Welcome to the PLA Calculator! This Python-based tool is designed to help you calculate and manage your 3D printing material usage, specifically focusing on Polylactic Acid (PLA) filament.

Features:

Material Usage Calculation: Estimate the amount of PLA filament required for your 3D prints based on model volume and filament density.
Cost Estimation: Calculate the cost of your 3D print projects by factoring in the cost per kilogram of PLA filament.
Supports Multiple Units: Supports both metric and imperial units for input and output.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple command-line interface for ease of use.
Open Source: Released under the MIT License, contributions are welcome!
